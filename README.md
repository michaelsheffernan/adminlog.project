# Login Limiter App 🔐

A mini Python project that simulates a secure login system with a limited number of attempts.

✅ What I learned:
- How to use `while` loops for user input control
- Conditional logic (username & password check)
- How to build an actual program flow with consequences

Built as part of my journey to mastering Python and becoming an AI engineer.
